I have developed a bunch of material to guide students in their Master thesis supervision process:

- [Thesis companion (new!)](https://thesis.hannesdatta.com)
- [Thesis guide - PDF, legacy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g66w6bn0q30gxio/thesis_guide.pdf?dl=0)
- [Tilburg Science Hub - reproducible workflows to manage data- and computation-intensive projects](https://tilburgsciencehub.com)
