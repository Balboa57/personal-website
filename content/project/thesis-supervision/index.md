I have developed a bunch of material to guide students in their Master thesis supervision process:

- [Thesis guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g66w6bn0q30gxio/thesis_guide.pdf?dl=0)
- [Tilburg Science Hub - reproducible workflows to manage data- and computation-intensive projects](http://tilburgsciencehub.com)
- [Tutorial for reproducible workflows](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorial)
