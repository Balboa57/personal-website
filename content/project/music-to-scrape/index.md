Inspired by Zyte's books.toscrape.com, I created a platform that simulates the behavior of thousands of users that listen to music at music-to-scrape.org. You can use the publicly available website and API to learn how to scrape. Built by myself and Tilburg Science Hub's Thierry Lahaije, and featured in the [Journal of Retailing](../../publication/scraping-retailing), the platform helps students and data science enthusiasts to learn scraping.

Visit [music-to-scrape.org](https://music-to-scrape.org) now, and also check out my complementary open education web scraping/API course at [https://odcm.hannesdatta.com]().
