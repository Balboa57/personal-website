In 2016 and 2017, I have applied for a VENI grant from [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research). I failed the 2016 round, but did manage to secure the 250,000 EUR funding in the 2017 round.

Here, I'd like to share the application material, reviewer evaluations, and my responses to the reviewers. Maybe it helps in preparing your own grant applications.

- [2016 material](/files/Veni2016_HDatta.zip) (didn't make it)
- 2017 material (did make it; [application](/files/Veni2017_HDatta.zip), [end report](/files/Veni2017_endreport.pdf))
- [video explaining my application process](https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/38c4b6d09de440b19370daf018d9ea4d1d)
