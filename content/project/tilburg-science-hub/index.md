I have created [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com) as an open source learning platform for students and researchers interested in open science. On the platform, users can discover how to efficiently manage data-intensive projects using open source tools. Next to documenting the *process of doing research*, the site hosts several tutorials and workflow templates that get you started improving your research productivity instantly.

I am running Tilburg Science Hub jointly with [Tobias Klein](https://www.tobiasklein.ws), [Shrabastee Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/view/shrabastee), [Lachlan Deer](https://lachlandeer.github.io) and [Alexander Vossen](https://www.jads.nl/researcher/alexander-vossen/), as well as a team of about 10 research assistants recruited from various schools at Tilburg University. Kickstarted with a 750,000 EUR grant from [Tilburg School of Economics and Management](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management), Tilburg Science Hub currently is being integrated with Tilburg University, maximizing its benefits to the entire Tilburg research community.

With more than 30,000 monthly visitors from around the world, Tilburg Science Hub has become a key resource to learn about how to implement open science in research projects.
