This GitHub repository hosts the (admittedly rudimentary) source code for an R package that hosts some of the recurring functions that I have coded for research projects, among others:

- computation of Gaussian Copula correction terms following [Park and Gupta 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1120.0718)
- estimation of MCI and MNL market share attraction models, following [Fok et al. 2002](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0731-9053%2802%2916010-5) and [Cooper and Nakanishi 1988](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/lee.cooper/MCI_Book/BOOKI2010.pdf)
- implementation of fast unit root tests, following [Elder and Kennedy (2001)](http://debis.deu.edu.tr/userweb//onder.hanedar/dosyalar/elder.pdf)
