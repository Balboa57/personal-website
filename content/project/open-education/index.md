I have developed an open education format, which I successfully applied to two of my courses:
- [Online Data Collection and Management](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com), and
- [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com).

The courses consist of course websites developed open source on GitHub (see repositories for [Online Data Collection and Management](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-odcm) and [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep) here). On the sites, I offer tutorials (e.g., in Jupyter Notebook, in R), and provide syllabi and grading guidelines that can be easily adapted.
