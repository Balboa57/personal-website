As project lead of tilburg.ai, I'm leading a University-wide initiative to boost the use of AI in education. Together with a team with educational developers, teachers and student assistants, we am responsible for (a) running an R&D lab to develop and test new AI tools at Tilburg University, (b) organizing workshops for students and teachers, and (c) blogging about inspiring use cases at Tilburg University and beyond.

Next to the University-wide project, I am also coordinating efforts at Tilburg School of Economics and Management (TiSEM) for the use of AI in education, jointly with Matthijs van Gils - who's been hired on a TiSEM grant for the project duration of two years.
