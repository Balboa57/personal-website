I kind of have a hard time with journalists cracking jokes about my last name - "Datta loves data".
But well, the interview in this special issue of the "New Scientist" did turn out very nice.

In the interview, you can

- get to know some background information on why I ended up doing research on online streaming,
- learn why I think that a combination of pre-recorded web casts and live streams will help you to teach better,
- reflect on how principles of reproducible science can help you to conduct better research, and
- get convinced that researchers need to be legally allowed to conduct web scraping.
