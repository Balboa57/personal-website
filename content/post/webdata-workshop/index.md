While visiting [WU Vienna for a talk](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/marketing), I have given a workshop on collecting web data using web scraping and APIs. [__Download the slide deck here__](/files/webdata_workshop.pdf).

# Workshop Invitation

## Learning Goals

*	How to select web data sources and extraction methods for academic research?
*	How do a researcher’s design decisions affect research validity, technical feasibility, and ethical/legal risks of collecting web data?
*	Receive feedback on own the design of one’s web data collection

## Preparation

- Required reading: [Fields of Gold: Web Scraping and APIs for Impactful Marketing Insights](../../publication/scraping)
-	Familiarize yourself with web scraping and APIs.	If unfamiliar with web scraping or APIs, please [follow the interactive tutorial in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hannesdatta/course-odcm/blob/master/content/docs/tutorials/webdata-for-dummies/webdata-for-dummies.ipynb)
-	Submit an activity for feedback
    - Present an [idea for an interesting data context to study](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/project/workplan/activity2/)
    - Provide a first (conceptual) [design](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/project/workplan/activity3/) of your data collection
    - Submit an [initial prototype](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/project/workplan/activity4/) (no matter whether in Python, R, etc.).

- Submit any question you may have concerning the use and/or collection of web data in academic research.

<!--## Submissions-->
