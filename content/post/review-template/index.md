I've recently attended a webinar by the editors of the *Journal of Marketing* on writing efficient peer reviews.

On the basis of that seminar, I've [created a Word template](/files/ReviewTemplate.dotx), encompassing these five sections:

1. Synopsis of the paper
2. Evaluation of contribution
3. Major conceptual and methodological weaknesses and recommendations
4. Evaluation of readability
5. Minor comments and suggestions

While I did implicitly gave feedback along these dimensions on papers I have reviewed in the past, the proposed structure did add more clarity to my reviews.

Feel free to [use (and modify) it](/files/ReviewTemplate.dotx)!
