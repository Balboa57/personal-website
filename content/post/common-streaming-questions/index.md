Music streaming is all around us - but, who benefits from it, and why do some artists manage to make millions, while others suffer to make a living?

I was asked by German media to comment upon a few questions concerning the streaming business model. I'm sharing my notes here.


## Question: Who benefits from the music streaming business model?

In the early 2000s, the rise of online piracy triggered a dramatic decline in music revenue, worldwide. The emergence of online music streaming platforms like Spotify turned the tide, by increasing consumers willingness-to-pay for music. To day, online music streaming accounts for x% of industry revenue, and is widely recognized to be responsible for a development.

As such, the music industry has foremost benefited from the introduction of online music streaming. This includes innovation in the music sector, also artists.

My own research suggests that users have benefited, too. They discover more unique artists

There are a multitude of downturns, including artist compensation.

- Labels suffer/lose power
  - artists at the end also lose power, royalty negotation power (labels verhandeln, wenn spotify powerful wird, geringere royalty rates, or less influence on payout)

- Consumers win variety in the short-run

- Digital platforms make profit, potentially can take out intermediaries (because of taking out labels);
  - but: other platforms on the rise


## Question: Why do some artists earn millions, while others struggle to make a living?

- "how many artists are supported in a market?"

- viel variety; but those that make variety do not make money
- label is important, playlist positions, extreme skewed distribution
- who benefits from the variety - platform, or artists that produce?

- regress major label dummy on streams, followers



## Question: Where does the money go?

Des weiteren wäre es interessant für uns herauszufinden:

Wohin fließt das ganze Geld aus einem klassischen 10 Euro Abonnement? (ich meine, da haben Sie heute während des Telefonats gesagt, dass Sie dazu keine Zahlen liefern können)

--> no comment



## Question: How powerful are the major music labels?

- relative to Spotify, [...]
- slide but will be updated...


## How easy is it to manipulate the streaming counts?




## Is it possible to see maniuplation? How to see it? Could it be a reason some artists end up in the streaming charts?



## Are some genres more likely to suffer from manipulation?



## Is UCPS a good alternative to the pro-rata model of payment?

--> subsidize variety

## What could we learn from internal data?
