abstract: We make the case for a cultural shift towards open science in academic marketing research to address growing concerns about research complexity and challenges surrounding replicability and reproducibility. We discuss how open science can increase the scientific rigor and credibility of research across diverse paradigms and practices within the field. We also provide guidance on implementing open science in empirical research for authors, journals, and institutions, highlighting the benefits and costs of adapting existing practices to the fieldâ€™s subdisciplines. Implementing open science practices requires concerted and collaborative efforts among authors, journals, and institutions to integrate its principles into their specific practices and policies.
