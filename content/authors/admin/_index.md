As an Associate Professor at one of the world's leading marketing departments, I develop advanced econometric models that guide managerial decision-making and inform public policy in the area of digital media consumption (e.g., on streaming services, on digital TV).

I have gained substantial experience working with large data sets and cloud computing. Apart from my interest in new media, I work on projects in the area of retailing.
