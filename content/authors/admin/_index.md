As an Associate Professor at one of the [world's leading marketing departments](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/marketing), I conduct
research in the area of digital media consumption (e.g., on streaming services, on digital TV), branding, and retailing.

My work has been published, among others, in the [*Journal of Marketing*](https://www.ama.org/journal-of-marketing/), [*Journal of Marketing Research*](https://www.ama.org/journal-of-marketing-research), and [*Marketing Science*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mksc).

I currently serve on the editorial review board of the *Journal of Marketing* (2020), and was named an [*MSI Young Scholar*](https://www.msi.org/research/msi-young-scholars/) (2019). For my research, I have won the  *Journal of Marketing's* [H. Paul Root Award](http://www.msi.org/research/awards/msi-h.-paul-root-award/) (2017).

<!-- My teaching has been awarded with Tilburg University's Teacher of the Year Award (2016), and Tilburg School of Economics and Management's Best Teacher Award (2019).-->

I have received my MSc Business Research and PhD in Quantitative Marketing at Maastricht University, The Netherlands.
